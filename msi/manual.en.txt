Welcome to use PaFile client.

PaFile client is used to download a "library" from a PaFile website, which is
different from other file sync service like dropbox.

1. Create a library on PaFile website;

2. Download the library from PaFile website;

3. Files added to this donwloaded library will automatically appear on PaFile website.

Don't add files to the "PaFile" folder. That would not make it appear on the website.
